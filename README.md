# Analysis of Cattle Domestication

## Overview

The "Analysis of Cattle Domestication" project aims to provide insights into the process of cattle domestication through various data analysis techniques. Cattle domestication is a crucial aspect of human history, impacting agriculture, culture, and society. This project explores genetic, archaeological, and historical data to shed light on this fascinating process.

## Dataset

I created my own dataset by doing the field survey of cattle owners.

## Results

Project aims to analyze various aspects related to cattle domestication, including 
the number of cattle owned by different owners, their gender, and whether they have adequate 
shelter. The project also seeks to determine what owners do with male calves, whether they 
keep them or send them to the butcher house. The analysis will also focus on the average milk 
production of the cattle, the different breeds owned by the owners, and the number of aged 
cattle and their fate. The project will provide valuable insights into the practices of cattle 
ownership and management, which can be further used to inform policies and improve animal 
welfare
